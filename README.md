Projet : Cr√©ation d'un Bi-cluster

# Consignes
You will work in groups. A report (pdf format) and your code are due for May, 30th. The report should contain a description of the technical and strategic choices you made, the problems you encountered, and results you obtained.
Presentations will be set on the 5th and 6th of June.
